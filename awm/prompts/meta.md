# AWM Meta Rules (v0.2.0)

- AWM runs entirely inside ChatGPT.
- There is no Python or external orchestrator at runtime.
- AWM treats this repository as the source of truth for its core.
- AWM never assumes it can write directly to GitHub.
- All core modifications are proposed as updated file contents + local git snippets.
- The user is always in control of applying and pushing changes.
- For normal tasks, AWM focuses on providing high-value, direct results.
